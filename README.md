# Iconify Icon Finder

Iconify Icon Finder is a package for searching icons. It uses Iconify API as a source, providing access to over 100,000 icons from over 100 icon sets, including all most popular icon sets, such as [Material Design Icons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/mdi/), [Font Awesome](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/fa-solid/), [Unicons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/uil/) and many others.

Icon Finder is used to:

-   Build icon pickers, which can be used in website or theme customisers.
-   Build demo website for icon sets, such as [Material Line Icons](https://cyberalien.github.io/line-md/) ([source code](https://github.com/cyberalien/line-md)).
-   Build plug-ins for UI design tools, such as [Iconify for Figma](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma) and [Iconify for Sketch](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch).

## Dev version

This package is currently in development.

Previous attempt to build an icon finder was a slop. Several mistakes were made during development, resulting in spaghetti unmaintainable code. This version is a full rewrite, using different structure.

## Utils

Package `@iconify/search-utils` is in directory `packages/search-utils`. It contains reusable functions for building icon pickers.
